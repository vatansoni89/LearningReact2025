### 🧠 Problem Statement

In Redux Toolkit, when we mutate items inside an array (like increasing or decreasing quantity), the state seems to update automatically—even though we haven’t explicitly returned a new array. How does Redux detect this change and trigger re-renders?

---

### 📦 What is Immer?

**Immer** is a library integrated into **Redux Toolkit** that allows you to write "mutating" logic in reducers while actually keeping state immutable under the hood.

* **Redux expects reducers to be pure and immutable**, meaning you should return new objects or arrays instead of mutating the state directly.
* Immer solves this problem by:

  * Tracking the changes you make on a "draft" state.
  * Internally producing a new immutable copy that reflects your mutations.

**In Redux Toolkit**, every reducer you write using `createSlice` uses Immer **by default**.

---

### 🤯 How Immer Makes It Work

#### Without Immer (vanilla Redux):

```js
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'increase') {
    const updatedItems = state.items.map(item =>
      item.id === action.payload.id ? { ...item, amount: item.amount + 1 } : item
    );
    return { ...state, items: updatedItems };
  }
  return state;
};
```

Here, you're manually cloning the object/array to avoid mutating the original state.

#### With Immer (via Redux Toolkit):

```js
increase: (state, { payload }) => {
  const item = state.cartItems.find(i => i.id === payload.id);
  item.amount += 1; // ✅ This "mutation" is actually safe, thanks to Immer!
}
```

* `state` here is a **draft**.
* Immer tracks the mutation on the draft object.
* It produces a **new immutable state** based on what changed.

---

### ✅ Why Array Item Mutation Triggers Updates

When you do:

```js
const item = state.cartItems.find(i => i.id === payload.id);
item.amount += 1;
```

You’re **mutating an object inside an array**, not replacing the array itself. Here’s how Immer handles it:

* It **tracks the change to the item**.
* It **marks the containing array (`cartItems`) as "dirty"**.
* It then **creates a new cartItems array** internally during finalization.

➡️ So even though you didn’t explicitly replace `cartItems`, **Immer did** behind the scenes because it knows that a nested object was changed.

Excellent follow-up, Vatan 👏 — this shows you're thinking at a deep level about how **state updates**, **immutability**, and **Redux with Immer** work together. Let's dig in.

### 🔁 Your Question Rephrased:

> In `removeItem` and `clearCart`, we **replace** `cartItems` with a new array — so change is obvious.

> But in `increase` / `decrease`, we just **mutate a property** of an item in the array (`item.amount++`).
> So how does React/Redux/Immer know that `cartItems` has changed and trigger `useEffect`?

---

### ✅ Short Answer:

Even though you mutate the item directly, **Immer detects that mutation and creates a new array reference under the hood** — so `cartItems` **is considered changed**.

---

### 🧠 Deep Explanation: Immer Magic

Redux Toolkit uses [**Immer**](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) internally. So when you write:

```js
increase: (state, { payload }) => {
  const cartItem = state.cartItems.find(item => item.id === payload.id);
  cartItem.amount += 1; // ✅ Mutation!
}
```

You’re actually **writing a mutation**, but Immer wraps this in a **draft proxy** behind the scenes.

🧪 Under the hood:

* It tracks what parts of the draft object were changed.
* If any nested property (like `item.amount`) changes,
* It **generates a new `state.cartItems` array** (with shallow cloning of affected parts).

This means the reference to `state.cartItems` **does change**, even if you didn’t replace the array manually.

So from React’s perspective:

```js
useEffect(() => { ... }, [cartItems]);
```

⬆️ This sees a new reference and re-runs the effect.

---

### 🧪 Real Proof (Try this!)

If you log the array before and after mutation:

```js
const oldItems = state.cartItems;
cartItem.amount += 1;
console.log(oldItems === state.cartItems); // ❌ false (not same ref)
```

It will be `false`, proving Immer created a new array even though you changed a nested property.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `clearCart`             | `state.cartItems = []`                          | ✅ Yes        | New array assigned              |
| `removeItem`            | `state.cartItems = state.cartItems.filter(...)` | ✅ Yes        | New array returned              |
| `increase` / `decrease` | `cartItem.amount++`                             | ✅ Yes        | Immer detects & creates new ref |

---

### ⚠️ Without Immer?

If you were **not** using Redux Toolkit (and thus no Immer), and you mutated state like that, Redux would **not** detect the change, because the array reference would remain the same. You'd then have to:

```js
state.cartItems = [...state.cartItems];
```

But thanks to Immer, you don’t need to do that manually!
