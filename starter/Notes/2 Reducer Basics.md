ðŸ’¥ **BOOM! Vatan, this is the perfect deep dive â€” you're asking:**

> When I write:

```js
onClick={() => dispatch(removeItem(id))}
```

ðŸ‘‰ How does that call end up triggering:

```js
removeItem: (state, action) => { ... }
```

And more importantly:

> Where do `state` and `action` come from in that reducer function?

Letâ€™s break it down **brain-friendly + technically accurate**, like a real-time movie ðŸŽ¬

## ðŸŽ¬ Scene-by-Scene: How `removeItem(id)` â†’ `state, action` Works

---

### âœ… 1. You click the "Remove" button:

```js
onClick={() => dispatch(removeItem(id))}
```

ðŸ’¥ This calls the **action creator**: `removeItem(...)` â€” the one that was auto-generated by `createSlice()`.

So:

```js
removeItem(id) === { type: 'cart/removeItem', payload: id }
```

âœ… You just created a normal action object.

---

### âœ… 2. You dispatch that action:

```js
dispatch({ type: 'cart/removeItem', payload: 'abc123' });
```

Redux takes that action and says:

> "Hey, which reducer is responsible for this type?"

It checks your store setup:

```js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cart: cartReducer,
  },
});
```

It finds `cartReducer` â†’ and passes the action to it.

---

### âœ… 3. Inside `cartReducer` â€” how `state` and `action` appear

Remember: `createSlice()` creates a big reducer that looks like:

```js
function cartReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'cart/clearCart':
      return { ... };
    case 'cart/removeItem':
      return removeItem(state, action); // <--- the reducer function you defined
    ...
  }
}
```

So when your reducer hits this:

```js
removeItem: (state, action) => {
  const itemId = action.payload;
  state.cartItems = state.cartItems.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId);
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Redux automatically:

* Passes the current **`state`** (from the store)
* Passes your dispatched **`action`** object

Thatâ€™s where:

* `state` = current cart slice state
* `action` = `{ type: 'cart/removeItem', payload: id }`

---

## ðŸ§  Key Idea to Remember

> ðŸŽ¯ **Redux injects `state` and `action` into the reducer function automatically.**
> You donâ€™t have to initialize them â€” **Redux does it** as part of dispatching.

## ðŸ’¡ TL;DR Flow Recap:

| Step             | What Happens                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `removeItem(id)` | Action creator â†’ returns `{ type, payload }`    |
| `dispatch(...)`  | Sends action to Redux store                     |
| Redux            | Finds matching reducer via `type`               |
| Calls            | `removeItem(state, action)` with correct values |
| You              | Modify the `state` using `action.payload`       |
