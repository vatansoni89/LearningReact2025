Great question again, Vatan 👏 — you're digging deep into how Redux Toolkit works under the hood. Let's break down exactly what this line exports and what’s inside:

---

## 🧾 Code in Question:

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import cartReducer from './features/cart/cartSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cart: cartReducer,
  },
});
```

---

## ✅ What does `configureStore(...)` return?

It returns a fully functional **Redux store object**, just like the one you’d get from `createStore` in classic Redux, but with many smart defaults.

### So this line:

```js
export const store = configureStore({ ... });
```

Exports a complete `store` object that includes:

| Property                     | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `store.dispatch`             | Used to dispatch actions to update the state             |
| `store.getState()`           | Returns the current state tree                           |
| `store.subscribe()`          | Lets you run a callback whenever the state changes       |
| `store.replaceReducer()`     | Used for dynamic reducer injection (advanced)            |
| `store[Symbol.observable]()` | Supports observable integrations (like Redux-Observable) |

And also under the hood:

* Automatically sets up **Redux DevTools**
* Adds built-in **middleware** (like `redux-thunk`)
* Warns about mutations in state

---

## 🧠 What Is the Shape of the Redux State?

You passed:

```js
reducer: {
  cart: cartReducer
}
```

So the final Redux state will look like this:

```js
{
  cart: {
    cartItems: [],
    amount: 0,
    total: 0,
    isLoading: true
  }
}
```

> `cartReducer` defines what's inside the `cart` key of the global state.

---

## 🚀 So, the Final Export:

```js
export const store = configureStore({ reducer: { cart: cartReducer } });
```

**Exports a Redux store object** that:

* Can be used in `<Provider store={store}>`
* Can be accessed by hooks like `useSelector`, `useDispatch`
* Maintains the entire app's state

---

## ✅ Usage in App

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './store';

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

This makes the exported `store` available to every component.
