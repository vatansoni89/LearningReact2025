Awesome, Vatan! 💡
You're now connecting **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** with **Inversion of Control (IoC)** — a key relationship in modern software architecture.

---

## 🧠 Short Answer:

> **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** is a **design principle**.
> **Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a **design pattern** (or mechanism) that helps **implement DIP**.

---

## 🎯 In Simple Terms:

* **DIP** says:
  “**Depend on abstractions**, not concrete classes.”

* **IoC** says:
  “**Don’t create your dependencies yourself** — let someone else provide them.”

So:

> ✅ **IoC is the “how”** to achieve the **“what”** defined by DIP.

## 🔗 Relationship Summary:

| Concept | Description                                                       | Role |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| **DIP** | A principle — design classes to depend on interfaces/abstractions | Why  |
| **IoC** | A pattern — removes dependency construction from the class        | How  |

---

## 🔧 Without IoC — You violate DIP

```csharp
class NotificationManager
{
    private EmailService _service = new EmailService(); // concrete + tightly coupled ❌
}
```

* You’re depending directly on a concrete class.
* Even if `EmailService` implements an interface, you’re **still creating it manually**.

---

## ✅ With DIP + IoC

```csharp
class NotificationManager
{
    private readonly IMessageService _service;

    public NotificationManager(IMessageService service) // dependency is injected
    {
        _service = service;
    }
}
```

Now your class **depends on an abstraction (DIP)**
and **receives the dependency externally (IoC)**.

---

## 🔥 Enter Dependency Injection (DI)

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is the most popular **IoC technique**.

> So:
> ✅ **DI is a form of IoC**, and
> ✅ It enables you to implement **DIP** cleanly.

---

## 🧪 Real Example in ASP.NET Core

```csharp
// 1. Define abstraction
public interface IMessageService
{
    void Send(string msg);
}

// 2. Implement it
public class EmailService : IMessageService
{
    public void Send(string msg) => Console.WriteLine("Email: " + msg);
}

// 3. Use it via constructor injection
public class NotificationManager
{
    private readonly IMessageService _service;

    public NotificationManager(IMessageService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public void Notify() => _service.Send("Hello!");
}
```

### 4. Configure IoC container (in ASP.NET Core `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`):

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMessageService, EmailService>();
services.AddScoped<NotificationManager>();
```

### 5. Now ASP.NET will automatically **inject** `EmailService` wherever `IMessageService` is needed. 🔄

## 🧠 Big Picture

```text
[Your class]
    ↓ depends on
[Interface] (DIP)
    ↓ fulfilled by
[IoC Container] (IoC)
    ↓ provides
[Concrete class]
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept  | Description                                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| DIP      | Design principle: depend on abstractions                   |
| IoC      | Pattern: inversion of control (object creation delegated)  |
| DI       | Technique of IoC to inject dependencies                    |
| Together | IoC (via DI) is **how** you implement DIP in real projects |

Let me know if you want a working sample project with IoC, or how this fits with unit testing and mocking!
