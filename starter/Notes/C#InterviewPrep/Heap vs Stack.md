Based on the attached image, let me clearly explain **Stack vs Heap in C#** with the help of the diagram, code, and memory behavior.

## 📦 Code in the Image

```csharp
int yint = 100;

Test obj = new Test();
obj.Name = "Shiv";
obj.Age = 100;

int zint = yint;

Test obj1;
obj1 = obj;
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts from the Image

### 🔹 Stack:

* **Stores value types** and **references to objects on the heap**.
* Operates in **LIFO** (Last In First Out).
* Fast access, automatically managed.

### 🔹 Heap:

* Stores **actual object instances** (reference types).
* Manages memory dynamically.
* Slower access compared to stack, but needed for complex types.

---

## 🔍 Line-by-Line Breakdown (from the image)

### `int yint = 100;`

* `yint` is a **value type** → stored directly on the **stack**.
* Value `100` is stored at stack address (say `e274`).

---

### `Test obj = new Test();`

* `Test` is a **reference type**, so:

  * `obj` (the reference variable) is stored on the **stack** at, say, `e276`.
  * The actual object is created on the **heap** (address like `adc0`).

### `obj.Name = "Shiv"; obj.Age = 100;`

* Inside the heap:

  * Field `Name = "Shiv"`
  * Field `Age = 100`

This object lives at heap address `adc0`, referenced by `obj`.

---

### `int zint = yint;`

* `zint` gets a **copy** of the value from `yint`.
* Stored in its own **stack location** (say `e278`) with value `100`.

🟡 **Important**: This is **by value** → changing `yint` later won’t affect `zint`.

---

### `Test obj1 = obj;`

* Both `obj` and `obj1` are reference variables.
* `obj1` is created on the **stack** and stores the **same heap reference (`adc0`)** as `obj`.

🟢 **This is by reference** → changing `obj1.Age` will reflect in `obj.Age`.

## 📊 Stack vs Heap Summary from the Image

| Feature          | Stack                         | Heap                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Stores           | Value types, references       | Actual objects (reference types) |
| Allocation       | Fast and automatic            | Slower, dynamic (GC managed)     |
| Lifetime         | Ends with scope               | Lives until GC collects          |
| Example in Image | `yint`, `zint`, `obj`, `obj1` | Object created by `new Test()`   |

---

## 🧠 Visual in the Image

The image shows:

* Stack holding variables like `yint`, `zint`, `obj`, `obj1` with arrows pointing to:
* Heap object at `adc0` containing:

  * `"Shiv"`
  * `100`

✔ `obj` and `obj1` point to the **same heap address** → that's reference sharing.

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

* **Value types** (e.g., `int`, `bool`, `double`) are copied and stored on the **stack**.
* **Reference types** (e.g., class objects) are stored on the **heap**, and only their **reference (pointer)** lives on the **stack**.
* Assigning one reference type to another copies the **reference**, **not the object**.

Let me know if you want a demo or code that proves this in action using `Console.WriteLine()` or memory profiling tools.


Absolutely, Vatan! Here's a **table summarizing** how variables are stored in memory — and which ones **reuse the same memory address** or **copy the value** — based on your provided image and code.

---

### 📦 Code Recap:

```csharp
int yint = 100;

Test obj = new Test();        // reference type
obj.Name = "Shiv";
obj.Age = 100;

int zint = yint;              // value type

Test obj1;
obj1 = obj;                   // reference assignment
```

### 📊 **Stack vs Heap Memory Table**

| Variable      | Type          | Memory Location | Address/Value Stored          | Shares Memory With | Copy or Reference? |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `yint`        | `int` (value) | Stack           | `100`                         | —                  | ✅ Copy             |
| `zint`        | `int` (value) | Stack           | `100`                         | ❌ (new address)    | ✅ Copy             |
| `obj`         | `Test` (ref)  | Stack           | 📍 Reference to heap (`adc0`) | `obj1`             | 🔁 Reference       |
| `obj1`        | `Test` (ref)  | Stack           | 📍 Same reference (`adc0`)    | `obj`              | 🔁 Reference       |
| `Test` object | Class Object  | Heap            | Fields: `"Shiv"`, `100`       | —                  | Actual data        |

### ✅ Explanation

| Symbol        | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Copy        | A **new memory** is allocated and value is **duplicated**             |
| 🔁 Reference  | Memory **address is reused**, both variables **point to same object** |
| ❌ New Address | A separate location on stack is allocated                             |
| 📍 Heap Ref   | Reference (pointer) to a memory address in heap                       |

---

### 🧠 Key Memory Reuse Points

* `zint = yint` → **different address**, same value → ✅ copy
* `obj1 = obj` → **same heap address reused** → 🔁 reference
