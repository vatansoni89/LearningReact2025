ðŸ’¡ Fantastic observation, Vatan!
You're asking:

> In `store.js`, do we **have to** name the key `cart` because our slice name is also `"cart"`?

```js
reducer: {
  cart: cartReducer
}
```

---

## âœ… Short Answer:

> **No, the key name (`cart`) in the store does not have to match the slice name.**

You can name it anything you want â€” but that name controls **how you access the state** in `useSelector`.

---

## ðŸ§  Letâ€™s Explain with Example:

Say your slice is:

```js
const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart', // this is only used for action type prefixing
  initialState,
  reducers: { ... }
});
```

And in your store:

```js
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    myBag: cartSlice.reducer, // ðŸ‘ˆ you can name this anything
  },
});
```

Then, in your component:

```js
const { amount } = useSelector((state) => state.myBag);
```

âœ… You must now use `state.myBag` instead of `state.cart`.

## âœ… Important Distinction

| Concept                           | What it Affects                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `name: 'cart'` in `createSlice()` | Affects the action `type` prefix: `'cart/removeItem'` |
| `cart:` key in `configureStore()` | Affects how you access state: `state.cart`            |

So these two names **can be different**, but here's how they influence your app:

| Place                            | Affects                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `createSlice({ name: 'cart' })`  | Action types â†’ `'cart/removeItem'`          |
| `reducer: { cart: cartReducer }` | State shape â†’ `state.cart` in `useSelector` |

---

## âœ… TL;DR:

> You donâ€™t **have to** name it `cart` in `store.js`.
> But whatever name you give it will become the key under `state`.

```js
// This:
reducer: {
  bag: cartReducer,
}

// Requires:
useSelector((state) => state.bag.amount)
```

Want to try renaming it and see the log output for clarity? Or create multiple slices and combine them? Let me know!
