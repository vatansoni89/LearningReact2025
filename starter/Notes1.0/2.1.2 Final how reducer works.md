Excellent follow-up, Vatan 👏— this is one of the most **critical "aha!" moments** in learning Redux Toolkit (RTK).

Let’s **de-mystify** this once and for all:

---

## ✅ Recap of the Code:

```js
// cartSlice.js
const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState: { amount: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.amount++ }
  }
});

// store.js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    basket: cartSlice.reducer  // 💡 KEY LINE
  }
});
```

Then in a component:

```js
const amount = useSelector((state) => state.basket.amount);
```

---

## 🔍 So... What’s Happening Behind the Scenes?

### Step 1: `cartSlice.reducer` is a function

Yes — a **pure function** like this:

```js
(state, action) => {
  if (!state) return { amount: 0 }; // ← initialState
  // handle actions here
}
```

You don’t see this code because `createSlice` generates it for you.

---

### Step 2: `configureStore()` wires this function to Redux

When you write:

```js
reducer: {
  basket: cartSlice.reducer
}
```

This is passed internally to `combineReducers()` like:

```js
combineReducers({
  basket: cartSlice.reducer
});
```

Redux now knows:

* You have a "basket" section in your global state
* It should be **managed by this reducer function**

---

### Step 3: Redux calls reducer with undefined (init phase)

At startup, Redux runs all reducers like this:

```js
state.basket = cartSlice.reducer(undefined, { type: '@@INIT' });
```

Because:

* Redux doesn't yet know what `state.basket` is
* It passes `undefined` as first param
* That triggers the reducer to return `initialState`:

```js
// cartSlice.reducer(undefined, INIT_ACTION)
→ returns { amount: 0 }
```

This becomes the first value of `state.basket`.

---

### ✅ Final State Tree

```js
store.getState(); 
// → { basket: { amount: 0 } }
```

So your selector works:

```js
useSelector((state) => state.basket.amount)
// → 0
```

---

## 💡 Analogy: Think of a School

```js
reducer: {
  basket: cartSlice.reducer
}
```

* You're saying: "Hey Redux, let this **teacher** (reducer function) manage the 'basket' section of the report card."
* On first day, Redux asks: “What’s the initial report?”
* The teacher says: `{ amount: 0 }`
* That becomes the first report for the `basket` section

## 🔚 Summary

| Concept                        | Behind the Scenes                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cartSlice.reducer`            | Function that returns new state                           |
| Called with `undefined`        | Returns `initialState`                                    |
| Mounted at `basket`            | So lives at `state.basket`                                |
| Selector `state.basket.amount` | Works because `cartSlice.reducer` returns `{ amount: 0 }` |

---

Perfect! Let's simulate everything **without Redux Toolkit** so you **see the wiring step-by-step** — like building Redux from scratch.

---

### 🧱 GOAL:

Mimic this using plain JavaScript:

```js
reducer: {
  basket: cartSlice.reducer
}
```

---

## ✅ 1. Define a Basic Reducer Manually

```js
// cartReducer.js
const initialState = { amount: 0 };

function cartReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  if (action.type === 'cart/increment') {
    return { ...state, amount: state.amount + 1 };
  }
  return state; // return unchanged state
}
```

✅ This is equivalent to `cartSlice.reducer`.

---

## ✅ 2. Combine Reducers into a Store

```js
// mimic combineReducers
function combineReducers(reducers) {
  return function rootReducer(state = {}, action) {
    const newState = {};
    for (let key in reducers) {
      newState[key] = reducers[key](state[key], action);
    }
    return newState;
  };
}
```

This is what Redux does under the hood when you do:

```js
reducer: {
  basket: cartReducer
}
```

---

## ✅ 3. Create a Simple Store

```js
let rootReducer = combineReducers({
  basket: cartReducer // 🔥 this is the key!
});

let storeState = rootReducer(undefined, { type: '@@INIT' }); // boot up

console.log(storeState); // 👉 { basket: { amount: 0 } }
```

This simulates `configureStore()` + `combineReducers()` + first call to reducer with `undefined`.

---

## ✅ 4. Dispatch an Action

```js
storeState = rootReducer(storeState, { type: 'cart/increment' });

console.log(storeState); // 👉 { basket: { amount: 1 } }
```

You see how dispatching an action results in updated `state.basket.amount`!

---

## ✅ 5. Mimic `useSelector`

Let’s write our own `useSelector`:

```js
function useSelector(selector) {
  return selector(storeState);
}

// Now simulate a component:
const amount = useSelector((state) => state.basket.amount);
console.log(amount); // 👉 1
```

---

## 🔁 Now Full Circle

Redux Toolkit is doing the **same thing**, but:

* `createSlice()` generates the reducer for you
* `configureStore()` handles combining reducers
* `useDispatch()` and `useSelector()` work with React context + hooks

---

## 🧠 Final Analogy

Think of:

* **`cartSlice.reducer`** like a personal accountant: it manages one folder (`basket`)
* **`combineReducers`** is the company hiring different accountants for different folders
* **`state.basket.amount`** is the number in the basket folder
* **`useSelector()`** just reads that number

---

Would you like to simulate multiple slices (like `cart` and `user`) to see how state tree grows?
