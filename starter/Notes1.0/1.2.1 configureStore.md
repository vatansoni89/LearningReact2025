# 📘 `configureStore` in Redux Toolkit — Parameters, Custom Keys, and How It Works

---

## ✅ Syntax Recap:

```js
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cart: cartReducer,
  },
});
```

---

## 🔍 What is `configureStore()`?

`configureStore()` is a Redux Toolkit function that:

* Creates a Redux store
* Sets up middleware (like `redux-thunk`) automatically
* Enables Redux DevTools
* Accepts multiple configuration options

---

## 📦 Parameters of `configureStore()`

It accepts a **configuration object** with the following keys:

| Parameter        | Type               | Description                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `reducer`        | Object or function | Defines how the state is updated |
| `middleware`     | Function           | Add/remove middleware (optional) |
| `devTools`       | Boolean            | Enable/disable Redux DevTools    |
| `preloadedState` | Object             | Initial state override           |
| `enhancers`      | Array/Function     | For advanced store enhancements  |

---

## 🔁 Custom Key Example: Can You Rename `cart`?

Yes! You can give any name to the key — that key becomes the **namespace** in your Redux state.

### Example:

```js
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    shoppingBag: cartReducer,
  },
});
```

Now, your global Redux state will look like:

```js
{
  shoppingBag: {
    cartItems: [],
    amount: 0,
    total: 0,
    isLoading: true,
  }
}
```

And you must access it like this:

```js
const amount = useSelector((state) => state.shoppingBag.amount);
```

✅ The key (`cart`, `shoppingBag`, etc.) defines **where in the global state** your reducer’s data will live.

---

## 🔧 Under the Hood: How `reducer` Works

When you pass:

```js
reducer: {
  cart: cartReducer,
  user: userReducer,
}
```

Redux Toolkit combines those into one big reducer using `combineReducers()`:

```js
(state, action) => ({
  cart: cartReducer(state.cart, action),
  user: userReducer(state.user, action),
})
```

So `cart` and `user` become **state slices**.

## ✅ Summary

| Concept             | Explanation                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `reducer`           | Object with keys → each becomes a slice of the state |
| Custom key (`cart`) | Yes, can rename (e.g. `shoppingBag`)                 |
| `useSelector`       | Must match the key name you use in `configureStore`  |
| Redux state         | Reflects the keys you use in `reducer: { ... }`      |
| Behind the scenes   | Redux Toolkit uses `combineReducers()`               |
