Here are the **core principles of microservices architecture**, explained in the context of **.NET** development:

Great! Here's a **funny mnemonic** to remember **just the titles** of the microservices principles using a silly sentence:

## üî† Funny Mnemonic Sentence:

**"Single Loose Dancers Autonomously Forget API Rules, Observing Security In Azure."**

This maps to:

| Word             | Principle                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Single**       | Single Responsibility          |
| **Loose**        | Loosely Coupled                |
| **Dancers**      | Independent Deployment         |
| **Autonomously** | Autonomous (Own Data)          |
| **Forget**       | Statelessness                  |
| **API**          | API-First Communication        |
| **Rules**        | Resilience & Fault Tolerance   |
| **Observing**    | Observability                  |
| **Security**     | Security at Service Level      |
| **In Azure**     | Infrastructure as Code & CI/CD |

### üß± 1. **Single Responsibility (Decomposition by Business Capability)**

Each microservice should **focus on one business function** (e.g., user service, order service, payment service).

* **In .NET**:
  Structure each microservice as a separate **ASP.NET Core Web API** project handling a specific domain.
  Use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to guide service boundaries.

---

### üîó 2. **Loosely Coupled**

Services should communicate in a way that **minimizes dependency**.

* **In .NET**:
  Use **DTOs**, **API contracts**, and **interface-based programming**.
  Use **message brokers** (like **Azure Service Bus**, **RabbitMQ**, or **Kafka**) to decouple services asynchronously.

---

### üì¶ 3. **Independent Deployment**

Each service should be independently deployable and scalable.

* **In .NET**:
  Package each service as a **Docker container**.
  Use **Azure App Services**, **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)**, or **Azure Container Instances** for deployment.

---

### üß™ 4. **Autonomous (Own Data and Logic)**

A service should own its **database and logic**. No direct database sharing.

* **In .NET**:
  Use **EF Core** with **separate database schemas** for each service.
  Use **API calls** or **events** to communicate between services rather than SQL joins.

---

### üîÅ 5. **Statelessness**

Services should avoid keeping session or state between calls.

* **In .NET**:
  Store state in external stores like **Azure Redis Cache**, **SQL DB**, or **Cosmos DB**, not in memory.
  Use **JWT tokens** or **OAuth** for stateless authentication.

---

### üì° 6. **API-First Communication**

Each service should expose functionality via APIs.

* **In .NET**:
  Use **ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs** or **Controllers**.
  Document APIs using **Swagger/OpenAPI**.

---

### üßµ 7. **Resilience & Fault Isolation**

If one service fails, it should not bring down the whole system.

* **In .NET**:
  Use **Polly** for retries, circuit breakers, and fallbacks.
  Use **health checks** (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks`).

---

### üîç 8. **Observability (Monitoring, Logging, Tracing)**

You must be able to monitor and trace what‚Äôs going on.

* **In .NET**:
  Use **Serilog**, **Application Insights**, **OpenTelemetry**.
  Use **correlation IDs** across service boundaries.

---

### üîê 9. **Security at the Service Level**

Secure each service individually.

* **In .NET**:
  Use **IdentityServer**, **Azure AD B2C**, or **Auth0** for OAuth 2.0/JWT-based security.
  Validate tokens using **`[Authorize]`** attributes in controllers.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 10. **Infrastructure as Code & CI/CD**

Automate provisioning and deployments.

* **In .NET/Azure**:
  Use **Bicep**, **Terraform**, or **ARM templates** for infrastructure.
  Use **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub Actions** for pipelines.

| Microservice    | Responsibility       | Tech                             |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| UserService     | Register/Login Users | ASP.NET Core, EF Core, Azure SQL |
| ProductService  | Product catalog CRUD | ASP.NET Core, MongoDB            |
| OrderService    | Place orders         | ASP.NET Core, Azure Service Bus  |
| PaymentService  | Process payments     | ASP.NET Core, Stripe SDK         |
| GatewayService  | API Gateway          | YARP or Ocelot                   |
| IdentityService | Auth & token issuing | IdentityServer or Azure AD B2C   |
