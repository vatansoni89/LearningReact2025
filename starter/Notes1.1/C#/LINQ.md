Absolutely, Vatan! For **10+ years of experience**, LINQ interview questions often focus on:

* Deep understanding of **deferred execution**, **expression trees**, and **query optimization**
* Fluent syntax usage (`method vs query`)
* Complex operations: `GroupBy`, `Join`, `SelectMany`, `Aggregate`, `ToLookup`, etc.
* Real-world problem-solving (chaining, filtering, projections)
* LINQ to SQL/EF Core behavior

Here’s a **complete list of LINQ interview questions with examples and explanations**, specially curated for **senior .NET professionals**.

# 🔍 LINQ Interview Questions for 10+ Years of Experience

---

## 🔹 1. What is the difference between `IEnumerable`, `IQueryable`, `List`, and how does LINQ behave with them?

### ✅ Answer:

* `IEnumerable`: In-memory; executes queries on objects in memory (deferred).
* `IQueryable`: For remote data sources like EF Core; builds **expression trees** and sends to DB.
* `List`: Eager evaluation; LINQ operations use `IEnumerable` interface.

🔹 Example:

```csharp
var employees = dbContext.Employees;        // IQueryable
var filtered = employees.Where(e => e.Age > 30); // Translates to SQL

var list = employees.ToList();              // IEnumerable
var inMemory = list.Where(e => e.Age > 30); // Runs in memory
```

---

## 🔹 2. What is deferred execution in LINQ?

### ✅ Answer:

LINQ queries are not executed until you iterate over them.

🔹 Example:

```csharp
var result = list.Where(x => x > 5); // Not executed yet
foreach (var item in result)         // Execution happens here
    Console.WriteLine(item);
```

---

## 🔹 3. How does LINQ `SelectMany` differ from `Select`?

### ✅ Answer:

* `Select`: Projects each element into a new form.
* `SelectMany`: Flattens a nested collection.

🔹 Example:

```csharp
var customersWithOrders = customers.Select(c => c.Orders);        // IEnumerable<List<Order>>
var allOrders = customers.SelectMany(c => c.Orders);              // IEnumerable<Order>
```

---

## 🔹 4. What’s the difference between `First()`, `FirstOrDefault()`, `Single()`, `SingleOrDefault()`, and `DefaultIfEmpty()`?

| Method              | Throws if not found                  | Throws if multiple found | Returns null/default |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `First()`           | ✅                                    | ❌                        | ❌                    |
| `FirstOrDefault()`  | ❌                                    | ❌                        | ✅                    |
| `Single()`          | ✅                                    | ✅                        | ❌                    |
| `SingleOrDefault()` | ❌                                    | ✅                        | ✅                    |
| `DefaultIfEmpty()`  | ❌ (adds default if empty collection) | ❌                        | ✅                    |

---

## 🔹 5. How do you perform left join in LINQ?

### ✅ Example:

```csharp
var query = from e in employees
            join d in departments on e.DeptId equals d.Id into ed
            from d in ed.DefaultIfEmpty()
            select new {
                e.Name,
                Department = d?.Name ?? "No Department"
            };
```

---

## 🔹 6. How does `GroupBy` work in LINQ?

```csharp
var groups = employees
    .GroupBy(e => e.Department)
    .Select(g => new {
        Department = g.Key,
        Count = g.Count(),
        MaxSalary = g.Max(e => e.Salary)
    });
```

🔹 Also understand difference between `GroupBy` in LINQ to Objects vs EF Core.

---

## 🔹 7. What is the difference between `ToLookup()` and `GroupBy()`?

### ✅ Answer:

Both group items, but:

* `GroupBy()` is **deferred** execution.
* `ToLookup()` is **immediate**, like a multi-dictionary.

---

## 🔹 8. How does `Aggregate()` work?

### ✅ Answer:

Used for custom accumulations (reduce).

```csharp
var sum = numbers.Aggregate((a, b) => a + b);  // Sum of all numbers
```

Or with seed:

```csharp
string sentence = words.Aggregate("Result:", (acc, word) => acc + " " + word);
```

---

## 🔹 9. How to write dynamic LINQ queries?

* Use **predicate building** or `System.Linq.Dynamic` or `Expression<Func<T>>`.

Example with predicate:

```csharp
Func<Employee, bool> filter = e => e.Salary > 50000;
var highEarners = employees.Where(filter);
```

For more dynamic:

```csharp
var filtered = employees.Where(e => e.Name.Contains(searchTerm));
```

---

## 🔹 10. LINQ vs SQL – what gets translated and what doesn’t?

✅ In EF Core:

* `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy` → SQL
* `ToList()`, `AsEnumerable()` → materialize into memory

⚠ Anything after `ToList()` runs **in memory**.

---

## 🔹 11. How to optimize large LINQ queries?

✅ Best Practices:

* Use `.Select()` to reduce columns early.
* Don’t use `ToList()` before filtering.
* Chain `Where()` as much as possible.
* Cache where needed (`ToList()` if used frequently).

---

## 🔹 12. How does `Any()`, `All()`, `Contains()` work?

* `Any()`: Checks if at least one item matches.
* `All()`: Checks if **all** items match.
* `Contains()`: Checks for existence in collection.

---

## 🔹 13. How do you project to anonymous or custom types?

```csharp
var result = employees.Select(e => new {
    FullName = e.FirstName + " " + e.LastName,
    e.Age
});
```

Or custom type:

```csharp
var result = employees.Select(e => new EmployeeDTO {
    Name = e.Name,
    Age = e.Age
});
```

---

## 🔹 14. Can you explain query syntax vs method syntax?

### ✅ Query Syntax:

```csharp
from e in employees
where e.Salary > 50000
select e;
```

### ✅ Method Syntax:

```csharp
employees.Where(e => e.Salary > 50000);
```

✅ Both compile to the same IL code.

---

## 🔹 15. How does `AsEnumerable()` differ from `ToList()`?

* `AsEnumerable()` keeps it **deferred**, just changes the type.
* `ToList()` forces **immediate execution**.
