Absolutely, Vatan. Let’s deeply understand the **Singleton Pattern in C#**, step by step — with **reasoning first**, then **implementation**.

---

## 🔥 Problem Statement

> You want to ensure that **only one instance** of a class exists in the application — for example, a Logger, Configuration Manager, or Cache.

If multiple instances exist, it can cause:

* Log duplication or conflicts
* Conflicting configuration sources
* Increased memory usage

So, we want to \*\*create a class that:

* is instantiated only once
* provides a global point of access
* is thread-safe
* is lazy-loaded\*\*

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step with Reasoning and Code

---

### ✅ 1. **We need to prevent external instantiation**

**Reasoning:**
To ensure no one else creates an object of the class using `new`, we make the constructor `private`.

```csharp
public sealed class Logger
{
    private Logger()
    {
        // Prevent instantiation
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ 2. **We want only one instance available globally**

**Reasoning:**
To store that one instance, we declare a `private static readonly` field.

We make it `readonly` so no one can accidentally reassign it after it's initialized.

```csharp
private static readonly Logger _instance = new Logger();
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Expose the instance through a public property**

**Reasoning:**
Other classes need to access this single instance. So we provide a `public static` property to return the singleton.

```csharp
public static Logger Instance => _instance;
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Prevent inheritance**

**Reasoning:**
If someone inherits `Logger` and creates a subclass, it could allow multiple instances through the subclass.

So we mark the class as `sealed`.

```csharp
public sealed class Logger
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Thread-safety already handled**

**Reasoning:**
The above version is known as **eager initialization** — since `_instance` is created when the class loads.
It's **thread-safe** because static initializers in .NET are **guaranteed to execute only once** (by the CLR), even in multithreaded environments.

---

## ✅ Final Code: Singleton (Eager Initialization)

```csharp
public sealed class Logger
{
    private static readonly Logger _instance = new Logger();

    // Step 1: Private constructor
    private Logger()
    {
        // Prevent instantiation
    }

    // Step 3: Global access
    public static Logger Instance => _instance;

    // Sample method
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[LOG]: {message}");
    }
}
```

---

## 🕗 What if I want **lazy initialization**?

> Only create the instance when it's actually needed.

Then use the `Lazy<T>` class:

### 🔁 Lazy Singleton (Thread-Safe)

```csharp
public sealed class Logger
{
    private static readonly Lazy<Logger> _lazy = new(() => new Logger());

    private Logger() { }

    public static Logger Instance => _lazy.Value;

    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[LOG]: {message}");
    }
}
```

> ✅ This is **lazy**, **thread-safe**, and avoids creating the instance if it’s never used.

---

## 🔒 Why not use `static` class instead?

**Because static class:**

* Can’t implement interfaces (e.g., `ILogger`)
* Can’t be passed as a dependency via DI
* Has no instance-based lifetime management
* Always loads when the class is accessed, not lazy

Whereas Singleton:

* Is flexible
* Can implement interfaces
* Can be passed around like any object

---

## ✅ When to Use Singleton

| Use Case                 | Suitable?  |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Logging service          | ✅ Yes      |
| Configuration provider   | ✅ Yes      |
| Database connection pool | ✅ Yes      |
| Per-user context         | ❌ No       |
| Shared mutable state     | ⚠️ Careful |

---

Perfect choice, Vatan. Let's walk through the **Thread-Safe Lazy Singleton with Double-Check Locking** in the same **reasoning-first, then code** style.

---

## 🔥 Problem

> We want to create a **singleton** that is:

* Created only when needed (lazy)
* **Thread-safe**
* **Efficient** — doesn't lock every time you access the instance

So we’ll use a technique called **Double-Check Locking**.

---

## 🧠 What is Double-Check Locking?

It’s a performance optimization where we check the instance **twice**:

1. First, *outside* the lock → to avoid unnecessary locking
2. Then *inside* the lock → to make sure no other thread created the instance in the meantime

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step with Reasoning and Code

---

### ✅ 1. **Private static field (nullable)**

**Reasoning:**
We’ll store the singleton instance here. It starts as `null` and gets initialized later.

```csharp
private static Logger? _instance = null;
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Private static lock object**

**Reasoning:**
To ensure only one thread creates the instance, we use a private lock object.

```csharp
private static readonly object _lock = new object();
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Private constructor**

**Reasoning:**
Prevent external instantiation.

```csharp
private Logger() { }
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Public static Instance property — with Double-Check Locking**

**Reasoning:**

* First check: If `_instance` is already created, return it.
* Lock only if needed.
* Inside lock: Check again to avoid race conditions (another thread may have created the instance while we were waiting to enter the lock).

```csharp
public static Logger Instance
{
    get
    {
        if (_instance == null)
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                {
                    _instance = new Logger();
                }
            }
        }

        return _instance;
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Final Code: Thread-Safe Lazy Singleton (Double-Check Locking)

```csharp
public sealed class Logger
{
    // Step 1: Backing field
    private static Logger? _instance = null;

    // Step 2: Lock object
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    // Step 3: Private constructor
    private Logger()
    {
        // Do setup or init
    }

    // Step 4: Public accessor with double-check locking
    public static Logger Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null) // First check
            {
                lock (_lock)
                {
                    if (_instance == null) // Second check inside lock
                    {
                        _instance = new Logger();
                    }
                }
            }

            return _instance;
        }
    }

    // Sample method
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[LOG]: {message}");
    }
}
```
