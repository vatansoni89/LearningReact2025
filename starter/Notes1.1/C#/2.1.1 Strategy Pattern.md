Absolutely, Vatan! Let's explore the **Strategy Pattern in C#** step by step ‚Äî **starting with the reasoning** first (why we need it), then **implementing it with real-world examples**. This approach will help you not just understand it, but also explain it in interviews like a pro. üî•

---

## üéØ What Is the Strategy Pattern?

### üìå **Definition:**

The **Strategy Pattern** defines a **family of interchangeable algorithms (strategies)**, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

---

## üß† Why Do We Need It?

Imagine this situation:

You‚Äôre building a **payment system** that supports:

* Credit Card
* PayPal
* Crypto

You could use **`if-else` or `switch-case`** everywhere:

```csharp
if (paymentType == "CreditCard")
    ProcessCreditCard();
else if (paymentType == "PayPal")
    ProcessPayPal();
else if (paymentType == "Crypto")
    ProcessCrypto();
```

### ‚ùå Problems with this:

* Hard to **add new strategies** (e.g., UPI, Apple Pay).
* Breaks **Open/Closed Principle**.
* Code becomes **messy** and **not testable**.
* **Tightly coupled** logic ‚Äî no flexibility.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use **Strategy Pattern**

### Benefits:

| Feature              | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Decouples behavior | Logic is separated from the core                  |
| ‚úÖ Easy to extend     | Add new algorithms without touching existing code |
| ‚úÖ Testable           | Each strategy can be tested independently         |
| ‚úÖ Reusable           | Logic can be reused in other projects             |

## üß© Structure of Strategy Pattern

```csharp
// 1. Strategy Interface
interface IPaymentStrategy { void Pay(decimal amount); }

// 2. Concrete Strategies
class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentStrategy { ... }
class PayPalPayment : IPaymentStrategy { ... }

// 3. Context
class PaymentContext {
    private IPaymentStrategy _strategy;
    public PaymentContext(IPaymentStrategy strategy) => _strategy = strategy;
    public void ExecutePayment(decimal amount) => _strategy.Pay(amount);
}
```

---

## üß™ Full Working Example (Payment System)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Strategy Interface

```csharp
public interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    void Pay(decimal amount);
}
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Concrete Strategies

```csharp
public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid ‚Çπ{amount} using Credit Card");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid ‚Çπ{amount} using PayPal");
    }
}

public class CryptoPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid ‚Çπ{amount} using Bitcoin");
    }
}
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Context Class

```csharp
public class PaymentContext
{
    private IPaymentStrategy _strategy;

    public PaymentContext(IPaymentStrategy strategy)
    {
        _strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void SetStrategy(IPaymentStrategy strategy)
    {
        _strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void ExecutePayment(decimal amount)
    {
        _strategy.Pay(amount);
    }
}
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Client Code

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var context = new PaymentContext(new CreditCardPayment());
        context.ExecutePayment(2500);

        context.SetStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
        context.ExecutePayment(4500);

        context.SetStrategy(new CryptoPayment());
        context.ExecutePayment(9999);
    }
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Output:

```
Paid ‚Çπ2500 using Credit Card
Paid ‚Çπ4500 using PayPal
Paid ‚Çπ9999 using Bitcoin
```

---

## üîÑ When to Use Strategy Pattern?

* You have **different algorithms for a task** (e.g., sorting, filtering, payment).
* You need to **swap logic at runtime**.
* You want to **follow SOLID principles**: especially **Open/Closed** and **Single Responsibility**.

## üí° Real-World Use Cases:

| Domain      | Example                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Payments    | CreditCard, UPI, Wallets         |
| Sorting     | BubbleSort, QuickSort, MergeSort |
| Compression | Zip, Rar, Gzip                   |
| Export      | PDF, Excel, CSV                  |
| Validation  | Email, Phone, OTP                |

---

## üßµ Optional: Thread-Safe Strategy Switching

You can wrap `SetStrategy()` inside a lock if you‚Äôre in a **multi-threaded context**.

---

## üö´ Anti-Patterns

* Don‚Äôt use it if you have just **one behavior**.
* Don‚Äôt use it if behavior doesn‚Äôt change at runtime.

---

## üß† Interview Tip

**Q: Why not use `switch-case`?**

A: Switch-cases couple logic to the consumer. If we add new logic, we edit the consumer class, violating the Open/Closed Principle. Strategy pattern avoids that by encapsulating each behavior in its own class.

---

Would you like to see another use case like **sorting algorithms**, **compression strategies**, or maybe even **pricing strategy**?
