Sure Vatan! Let's go **step-by-step from the beginning** and explain `useMemo` in a **brain-friendly (BF)** way, with multiple examples:

---

# 🧠 `useMemo` — From the Beginning

## 🚩 Problem Statement:

In React, **expensive calculations** inside a component run **on every render**, even if their result **hasn't changed**.

🔻This hurts performance especially when:

* You have heavy computations (sorting, filtering, etc.)
* Or child components that depend on derived values

---

## ✅ Solution: `useMemo`

```js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

* `useMemo` **caches the result** of the function
* It **only re-computes** when values in the dependency array change

---

## 💡 Simple Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine you're calculating your electricity bill:

* If the number of units hasn't changed, why re-calculate every time you open the app?
* You just keep the **last calculated result** (memoized).

---

## ✅ Syntax:

```jsx
const result = useMemo(() => {
  // heavy/expensive calculation
  return ...;
}, [dependencies]);
```

* If dependencies **don’t change**, React skips the calculation
* If they **do change**, React **recomputes**

---

## ✅ Basic Example: Avoid recalculating on every render

```jsx
import { useMemo, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [multiplier, setMultiplier] = useState(2);

  const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating...");
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
      total += i;
    }
    return total * multiplier;
  }, [multiplier]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Result: {expensiveResult}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Re-render</button>
      <button onClick={() => setMultiplier(multiplier + 1)}>Change Multiplier</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 👀 What Happens?

* Pressing **Re-render** won't log “Calculating…” because multiplier hasn't changed.
* Pressing **Change Multiplier** triggers recalculation.

## 🛑 Without Dependency Array (BAD)

```js
const val = useMemo(() => compute(), []);
```

Means: Only run `compute()` **once when the component mounts**. Never again.

This can be fine for one-time setups, like:

```js
const token = useMemo(() => generateToken(), []);
```

But it's **dangerous** if you depend on other variables that change — because it’ll always use the old value.

## 🧠 `useMemo` vs `useCallback`

| useMemo                         | useCallback                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Memoizes a **computed value**   | Memoizes a **function**                      |
| Returns: the result             | Returns: the function                        |
| Use when: expensive calculation | Use when: function passed to child component |

---

## 🔥 Real Use Case: Filtered list

```js
const filteredUsers = useMemo(() => {
  return users.filter(u => u.name.includes(searchTerm));
}, [users, searchTerm]);
```

* If `users` or `searchTerm` don’t change, the filter isn't run again.
* Great for performance if the list is big.

---

## ⚠️ Gotcha: `useMemo` doesn't prevent re-renders

It **prevents recomputation**, not re-renders.
If a parent re-renders, the component still re-renders — but the memoized value is reused.

---

## ✅ When to Use `useMemo`

Use it for:

* Heavy CPU-bound calculations
* Derived data (filters, sorts, maps)
* Avoiding unnecessary recalculations on re-renders

🚫 Don’t overuse it for everything — it has its own cost.

---

## 🧪 Experiment Yourself (BF task)

Try this in a small app:

```jsx
const [num, setNum] = useState(5);
const squared = useMemo(() => {
  console.log("calculating square...");
  return num * num;
}, [num]);
```

Play with re-renders and see how it works.

Would you like me to show a case where skipping `useMemo` leads to slow rendering with a list or child prop example?
