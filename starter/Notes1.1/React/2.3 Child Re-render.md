# 🧠 React Re-rendering: Why Child Component Function Runs Even if JSX Is Same

---

## 📌 Problem You Noticed

You wrote this:

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me</button>
      <Child />
    </>
  );
}

function Child() {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <div>I’m the child!</div>;
}
```

Even though `Child` doesn’t depend on `count`, **it still logs “Child rendered”** on every button click.

> 🤔 “Why is the `Child()` function running again? JSX is the same!”

Let’s explain this step by step.

---

## 🎬 React’s Re-rendering Logic (Scene-by-Scene)

### 1. You click the button

```jsx
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
```

➡️ This **updates the state** (`count`).

---

### 2. React re-runs the `Parent()` function

React must re-run `Parent()` to **get the latest JSX** after the state changed.

---

### 3. Inside `Parent()`, `Child()` is called again

Even though `Child` has no props or dependency on `count`, React **doesn't know that**, so it:

```js
calls Child() again // to get updated JSX
```

---

### 4. React compares JSX → Virtual DOM diffing

✅ If the returned JSX from `Child()` is **exactly the same**, React **skips updating the real DOM**.

But:

> 🚨 Even if the DOM isn’t updated, **`Child()` was still executed**, so you see the `console.log()`.

---

## 🧠 Why This Happens

React has **no way of knowing** whether your `Child()` is pure (side-effect free) or expensive — unless you help it.

So to be safe, it re-executes every component that’s inside a re-rendered one, even if it doesn’t seem to “depend” on the state that changed.

---

## 💡 Optimization: Prevent Re-run with `React.memo()`

You can **wrap Child with `React.memo()`**, which tells React:

> "Hey React, unless my props change, please don’t even bother re-running me."

### ✅ Updated Code

```jsx
const Child = React.memo(() => {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <div>I’m the child!</div>;
});
```

Now:

* When `Parent` re-renders
* If `Child`'s **props didn’t change**
* React **skips even calling `Child()`**

| Action                                         | What React Does                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `setCount` called                              | `Parent()` re-executes                  |
| JSX includes `<Child />`                       | `Child()` re-executes (unless memoized) |
| JSX same                                       | DOM not updated                         |
| Want to skip `Child()` function execution too? | Use `React.memo()`                      |

---

## 🔁 Recap

🧠 **By default**, React will:

* Re-execute function components inside re-rendered parents
* Diff their returned JSX
* Only update the DOM **if JSX is different**

💡 Use `React.memo()` to prevent **unnecessary function executions** when:

* Component doesn’t rely on state or props
* You want performance boost in large apps
