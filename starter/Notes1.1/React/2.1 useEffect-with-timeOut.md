So are we returning cleanup function before timeout execution?

---

Yes! You’ve got it — let’s break it down **very clearly and visually** so it sticks.

---

## ✅ What’s happening here?

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout ran");
  }, 3000);

  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    console.log("Component unmounted");
  };
}, []);
```

### 🧠 Sequence:

| Step                                                    | What Happens                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ✅ `MyComponent` mounts                                  | `useEffect` runs                |
| ✅ `setTimeout` starts                                   | Will execute after 3 sec        |
| ✅ Return function from `useEffect` is stored as cleanup | It won’t run *yet*              |
| ❌ Before 3 sec, component unmounts                      | 🔥 React runs cleanup **first** |
| ✅ `clearTimeout(timeoutId)` runs                        | Cancels the pending timeout     |
| ✅ `"Component unmounted"` logs                          |                                 |
| ✅ Timeout **never runs**                                | `"Timeout ran"` is skipped      |

---

## 📌 Key Point:

> **Cleanup function runs *before* the effect re-runs OR before component unmounts.**

---

## ✅ So Yes — Your Answer:

> ❓ Are we returning the cleanup function **before** timeout execution?

### ✔️ YES — we **define and return** the cleanup function immediately

But it **runs only if** the component **unmounts before 3 sec**, or if effect dependencies change (not in this case).

## 🔁 Timeline

```txt
[0s] Component mounts
[0s] Timeout is scheduled
[<3s] Component unmounts → cleanup runs
[3s] Timeout was cleared, so callback is skipped
```

---

## ⛔ If You Did Not Clear Timeout:

If the component unmounted at 2s and you didn't call `clearTimeout`, at 3s:

* Timeout callback still runs
* May try to update DOM/state of a component that’s gone
* React warns or crashes 🔥

Want a live codepen or interactive example where a component gets removed before timeout and causes this in real-time?
