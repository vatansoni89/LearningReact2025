Great! Let’s walk through your code step by step with a **React beginner-friendly explanation**, especially focusing on how `React.memo()` is working here.

---

### ✅ Your Setup

You have three components:

1. `LowerState` — the parent component with two state variables: `count` and `people`.
2. `List` — receives `people` as a prop and maps it.
3. `Item` — renders each person (not shown, assumed simple).

Let’s break this down:

---

## 🔹 Component 1: `LowerState.js`

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { data } from '../../../data';   // Assume this is an array of person objects
import List from './List';

const LowerState = () => {
  const [people, setPeople] = useState(data);  // people: list of users
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);       // count: just a number

  return (
    <section>
      <button
        className='btn'
        onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}
        style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}
      >
        count {count}
      </button>

      <List people={people} />
    </section>
  );
};

export default LowerState;
```

### 🔍 What’s happening here?

* You update only `count` when the button is clicked.
* `people` **never changes**.
* `List` gets the `people` array as a prop.

---

## 🔹 Component 2: `List.js`

```jsx
import Item from './Person';    // Item renders one person
import { memo } from 'react';

const List = ({ people }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {people.map((person) => {
        return <Item key={person.id} {...person} />;
      })}
    </div>
  );
};

export default memo(List);
```

### ✨ What does `memo(List)` do?

* `React.memo()` is a **Higher-Order Component (HOC)**.
* It **prevents unnecessary re-renders** of `List` if its props haven’t changed.
* So if `people` is the same reference as before (i.e., no `setPeople()`), React **will skip re-rendering** `List`.

---

## 🔍 How It Works in Your Case:

When you click the button in `LowerState`:

1. `setCount()` is called → `LowerState` re-renders.
2. `people` state didn’t change → same reference is passed to `List`.
3. Since `List` is wrapped in `memo()`, React checks:

   ```js
   if (previousProps.people === nextProps.people) {
       skip rendering List;
   }
   ```
4. So `List` doesn't re-render ✅ — **performance boost**!

---

## 🧠 If `memo()` Was Not Used:

Even if `people` stayed the same, React would **re-render `List` anyway** because the parent (`LowerState`) re-rendered.

---

### ✅ Final Thoughts

* **React.memo** works only if props are the same by **reference**.
* If you create inline objects like `{ name: 'Vatan' }`, a new object is created on every render → memo fails.
* Here, since `people` comes from `useState(data)`, its reference doesn't change → memo works.

---

### 🧪 You Can Try:

Add this to `List.js` to see it in action:

```js
console.log("List rendered");
```

Now click the count button. If `List` is wrapped in `memo()`, you **won't see the log again**, proving it's not re-rendered.

Great question! Let's explore this **in-depth and step-by-step** from a beginner’s lens.

---

## 🔍 Your Question:

> Why does React think the `people` prop didn’t change?
> Isn’t `LowerState` function re-running on every `setCount()` — so isn’t `people` being re-created?

---

## ✅ Clarifying the Confusion:

### 🤔 Does `people` get re-created on every render?

**NO** — and here's why.

```js
const [people, setPeople] = useState(data);
```

* `useState(data)` is only called **once** — when the component first mounts.
* After that, unless you explicitly call `setPeople(...)`, React **preserves the same reference** to the `people` array across renders.

Even though the **function `LowerState()` re-runs**, the **state `people` stays intact**, because:

👉 `React` keeps track of the state **outside the function** using its internal hooks system.

---

## 💡 Analogy:

Think of `useState` like this:

```js
// Under the hood
let stateStore = {
  people: [ { id: 1, name: 'Vatan' }, ... ],
  count: 0
};
```

Every time you call `setCount`, React re-runs your component, but:

* It **remembers the old value** of `people` from `stateStore`.
* So the `people` variable gets the **same reference** again.

Unless you call `setPeople(...)`, that memory (reference) stays the same.

---

## ✅ Why React.memo Works Here

`React.memo()` uses a shallow comparison (`===`) of props.

So this comparison is made:

```js
previousProps.people === nextProps.people;
```

If you didn’t call `setPeople`, then `people` is the **same array in memory**, and `React.memo()` skips re-rendering.

---

## 🧪 Prove It Yourself with Console Logs

### In `LowerState.js`:

```jsx
console.log("LowerState re-rendered");
```

### In `List.js`:

```jsx
console.log("List rendered");
```

When you click the button:

* You’ll see `"LowerState re-rendered"` ✅
* You **won’t** see `"List rendered"` ❌ (because memo blocked it)

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Concept                       | Explanation                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState()`                  | Keeps the same value across renders unless updated via `setState` |
| Component re-renders          | Yes, function runs again, but state is preserved                  |
| `React.memo()`                | Prevents re-render if props are shallow-equal (`===`)             |
| Array/object shallow equality | True only if reference is same (not recreated)                    |
| `people` is not recreated     | Because `setPeople` wasn’t called                                 |

---

Yes, exactly! ✅

Even if you call `setCount(...)`, and the component re-renders, the `people` object **remains the same** as long as you haven't called `setPeople(...)`.

---

## 📌 Here's Why:

### 1. **React’s `useState` stores the value across renders.**

This line:

```js
const [people, setPeople] = useState(data);
```

* Initializes `people` **only on the first render**.
* After that, unless you do `setPeople(...)`, the **same reference** to the `people` array is reused in every render.

---

### 2. **Updating other state variables (like `count`) does not affect `people`.**

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

Calling `setCount(count + 1)` will:

* Re-run the component.
* But React **remembers the last `people` value**, so it gives you the **same reference** again.

---

### 🔍 Let's Confirm With a Quick Console Test

```jsx
const data = [{ id: 1, name: "Vatan" }, { id: 2, name: "Dev" }];

function LowerState() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [people, setPeople] = useState(data);

  console.log("Component Rendered");
  console.log("People reference:", people);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <List people={people} />
    </>
  );
}

const List = React.memo(({ people }) => {
  console.log("List rendered");
  return (
    <ul>
      {people.map(p => <li key={p.id}>{p.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
});
```

Click the button:

* You’ll see `"Component Rendered"` again.
* But `"List rendered"` won’t appear — proving that:

  * `people` reference is unchanged ✅
  * So React.memo skips re-render ✅

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

| Action               | Does it re-create `people`?     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Initial render       | ✅ Yes, from `useState(data)`    |
| `setCount(...)`      | ❌ No, `people` remains the same |
| `setPeople(newData)` | ✅ Yes, new reference is created |

Let me know if you want to test how breaking that reference (e.g., by using `{ name: "Vatan" }` inline) causes memo to fail.
