## ✅ Redux Store's `reducer` Defines the Shape of Global `state`

When you do:

```js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cart: cartReducer,
    user: userReducer,
    products: productsReducer,
  },
});
```

➡️ This creates the global Redux state like:

```js
{
  cart: { ... },      // from cartReducer
  user: { ... },      // from userReducer
  products: { ... },  // from productsReducer
}
```

---

## 🧠 Think of It Like This:

Your `reducer` object is a **state blueprint** 🔧

```js
reducer: {
  myKey: myReducer
}
```

🔁 Means:

> "In `state.myKey`, store whatever `myReducer` returns."

---

## 📦 Visual Example

```js
// cartSlice.js
const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState: { amount: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.amount++ }
  }
});

// store.js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    basket: cartSlice.reducer  // 👈 custom key
  }
});

// Now in a component
const amount = useSelector((state) => state.basket.amount);
```

Even though the slice name is `'cart'`, the key in the store is `basket`.

✅ So yes:

> **The key in `store.reducer` becomes the property name in your global `state`.**

## 🔁 Recap Table

| Where                                             | Controls                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `createSlice({ name })`                           | Prefix for action types like `'cart/clearCart'` |
| `configureStore({ reducer: { key: reducerFn } })` | Key under `state`                               |
| `useSelector((state) => state.key)`               | Must match the reducer key name                 |

Let me know if you want to simulate combining multiple slices and reading their state together!
